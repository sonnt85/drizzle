Administering Drizzle
=====================

Drizzle is a unique database server because most of its functionality is
provided by plugins.  In fact, the primary job of :program:`drizzled`,
the Drizzle server daemon, is simply executing queries.

Administering Drizzle requires knowledge of several plugins for each
administration topic.  Don't worry though!  This does not mean administering
Drizzle is complex; rather, it means that you have options and flexibility.

Furthermore, the plugins are organized into discrete administrative
tasks (authorization, logging, etc.), so you do not have to learn
everything at once.  The following topics introduce you to the major
administration topics of Drizzle and which plugins are available for each.

If you have questions, :ref:`help` is available.
