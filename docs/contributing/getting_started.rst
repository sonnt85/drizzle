Getting Started
===============

Drizzle values community contributions the same as core developer
contributions.  All contributions, regardless of their author,
undergo the same rigorous testing and approval process before being
merged into the main code base.

The `Drizzle project <https://launchpad.net/drizzle>`_ is hosted on
`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/>`_ which handles code revision control,
bug tracking, mailing lists, and everything else needed to manage the
project.  For most contributions, you will need a
`Launchpad account <https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/NewAccount>`_.

Bazaar
------

Launchpad uses `Bazaar (bzr) <http://bazaar.canonical.com/>`_ for revision
control of the source repositories which includes code and documentation.
If you are not comfortable with :program:`bzr`, begin by reading the
`Bazaar documentation <http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/>`_.  You can
practice working with :program:`bzr` branches using your Launchpad account.

Help
----

If you have questions, please ask on the
`#drizzle <irc://irc.freenode.net/drizzle>`_
`Freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_ IRC channel or on the
`Drizzle Discuss <https://launchpad.net/~drizzle-discuss>`_ mailing list.
