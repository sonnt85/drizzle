Examples
========

These replication examples require a working knowledge of:

* :ref:`configuring_drizzle`
* :ref:`administering_drizzle`
* :ref:`drizzle_replication`

The examples are complete, but they may not explain every step in detail, and they probably need to be adapted to other environments.  In other words: the examples are guides, not drop-in solutions.  Free and commercial :ref:`help` is available.
