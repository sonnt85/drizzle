CREATE TABLE t1 (a int, b int, c int, PRIMARY KEY (a), KEY t1_b (b))
 ENGINE=InnoDB;

INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (3,1,1), (4,1,1);
INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) SELECT a+4,b,c FROM t1;

# should be range access
EXPLAIN SELECT a, b, c FROM t1 WHERE b = 1 ORDER BY a DESC LIMIT 5;

# should produce '8 7 6 5 4' for a
SELECT a, b, c FROM t1 WHERE b = 1 ORDER BY a DESC LIMIT 5;
