Drizzle is a community-driven open source project that is forked from the 
popular MySQL database.  

The Drizzle team has removed non-essential code, re-factored the remaining code 
and modernized the code base moving to C++.

Charter
 * A database optimized for Cloud infrastructure and Web applications
 * Design for massive concurrency on modern multi-cpu architecture
 * Optimize memory for increased performance and parallelism
 * Open source, open community, open design

Scope
 * Re-designed modular architecture providing plugins with defined APIs
 * Simple design for ease of use and administration
 * Reliable, ACID transactional

Compiling from source
---------------------

### Installing library dependencies:
# The easiest and recommended way is to use your package manager to install
# all build dependencies for the drizzle package. This will always
# install an up to date list of dependencies.
# If drizzle is not yet included in your distribution, then please configure
# your package manager to use these Drizzle repositories:
#  DEB: http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/ubuntu.html
#  RPM: http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/redhat.html


# Then start the build process with executing
sudo apt-get build-dep drizzle
# or
yum-builddep drizzle

### Compiling:
# If you got the source from bzr, run:
./config/autorun.sh
# The following steps are the same regardless of where you got the source
./configure --prefix=${HOME}/builds/drizzle && 
make &&
make test ||
echo "FAIL $?"

More information on compiling can be found at:
http://docs.drizzle.org/installing/from_source.html

### Running Drizzle:
# be sure you configured with a prefix before running make install
make install
cd ${HOME}/builds/drizzle
./sbin/drizzled --no-defaults --mysql-protocol.port=3306 \
     --basedir=$PWD --datadir=$PWD/var \
     >> $PWD/var/drizzle.err 2>&1 &
